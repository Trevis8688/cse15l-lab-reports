# Lab Report 5
## Part 1
**Example Student:** Please help me when I run the Doc Search server from week 5 I get this error. I gave the code the /technical/ directory which should have more than one file to find inside. I think there might be something wrong with either my file structure or the Doc Search server.

**Example TA:** It looks like there is an issue with the directory provided. Did you provide an absolute path to where the /technical/ directory is located on your machine? /
