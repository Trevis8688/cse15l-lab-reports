1. In the first example when running cd without an argument, the working directory did not change and there was no output because no directory was given to change to. This output was not an error because the directory did not change as intended when given no directory to change to.
2. When running the second example, the working directory changed from /home to /home/lecture1 where the directory /lecture1 is in /home. This is not an error because the working directory changed as intended to the directory provided.
3. In the third example, the terminal returned an error message because when given an argument, the cd command expects a directory/path to a directory, not a file. You can not change directories into a file, which in this case is Hello.java.
